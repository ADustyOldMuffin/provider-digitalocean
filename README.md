# provider-digitalocean

## Overview

`provider-digitalocean` is the Crossplane infrastructure provider for the
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). The provider that is built from the source
code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and
adds the following new functionality:

* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model DigitalOcean infrastructure and services
  (e.g. [Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/), etc.)
* Controllers to provision these resources in DigitalOcean based on the users
  desired state captured in CRDs they create
* Implementations of Crossplane's portable resource abstractions, enabling DigitalOcean
  resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
